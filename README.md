# BWARG-Master
Android - Double MJPEG decoder

This is the Master version of our BWARG project. See the Slave version too here : https://github.com/n0xew/BWARG-Slave/tree/master

This double MJPEG decoder is intended for live streaming from to cameras to your phone in a VR headset. 
You must have both slaves started on the same network, then you can input the ip or scan to find them.

An example we made with this project is to put 2 identical smartphones (with the right angle) on a remote controlled car; then you can drive in a first person view in VR!
